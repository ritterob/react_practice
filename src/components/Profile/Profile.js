            <p>
                I'm just an ordinary, average guy, doing some ordinary, average things. I don't think reading about me
                is enough to get anyone all excited. Maybe we should just not worry about me so much and perhaps
                determine why you came here. &ldquo;Ask not what your country can do for you, but what you can do for your
                country&rdquo;, and all that.
